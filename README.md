Shopping Cart and GST calculating problem
The formula for GST calculation is as under:

GST Amount = (GST x Original cost of the product or service) / 100

Net Price = Original cost of the product or service + GST amount

To remove GST:

GST Amount = Original cost of the product or service - [Original cost of the product or service x {100 / (100 + GST%)}]

Net Price = Original cost of the product or service - GST amount
